# Example action that shows a workflow using the ORCA CLI tool as part of a pipeline.
# This will build a container from a Dockerfile within a source repo.
# Environment variables required:
#    GITHUB_TOKEN: This is the token that you need to access the github container repository. It needs to be set as a secret within the environment section of the repo.
#    ORCA_API_KEY: This is the API token from the ORCA platform that is needed to run the CLI tool. This also needs to be set within the environment section of the repository.
#
# In order for this action to work, it will need to be associated with a source repository that has a Dockerfile.
# Also note that it is currently configured to be used on push to a specific branch.
